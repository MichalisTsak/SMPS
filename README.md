# SMPS

This project is based on the switched mode power supply [STEVAL-ISA081V1](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/steval-isa081v1.html)

I had to do the schematic and the pcb by referencing the BOM and the layout. This was my first interaction with altium and pcb designing and I didn't have enough time 
to check and validate everything(there are no errors) so expect some deviations from the original design. But I made my bill of materials to help you save some time in case you want to recreate it, 
since some components couldn't be found.

For this project I used altium and the extension Altium Library Loader.

### Note: 
1) If you can open the 3D viewer in your phone, it is implemented with Augmented Reality so you can see it in your space wherever you want and change it's size. It's real fun.
2) The PCB_PDF3D.PDF is a 3D pdf and doesn't work everywhere, i used Adobe Acrobat to open it.
